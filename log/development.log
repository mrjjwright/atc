<p>
The Alpine Training Center offers strength and conditioning training for all 
types of athletes. From professional mountain guides to avid recreationalists, 
our unique and proven programming focuses on three specific goals:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Promote full body strength</li>
<li>Increase work capacity, amount of work produced in set period of time</li>
<li>Build stamina</ol>

<p>
In short, anyone willing to grunt, spit, and sweat, and come back to do it all 
another day will benefit from this training.

<h2>Group workout sessions</h2>
<p>
Done in a group format, a training session is an hour of hard work. We push the 
athlete’s strength, we push their lungs and we push their limits. Our athlete’s 
range in age from 25-65 years young. We measure success only by the athlete’s 
performance in their chosen sport or career. 
</p>

<h2>Hybrid and specific training</h2>
<p>
We offer two types of training sessions, <b>hybrid</b> or <b>sport specific</b> sessions.
Hybrid training sessions involve general strength and work capacity efforts, for 
all athletes. 
Sport specific training sessions are for rock and ice climbers and ski conditioning training in the fall.
</p>

<p>We use a variety of training principles and modes to help athletes reach their 
goals. We carry sandbags, pull tires, climb ropes, squat, run and jump. You 
name it; we’ve probably tried it.

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
Located in an East Boulder warehouse at 1840 Commerce St, the gym has no 
mirrors, no juice bars and no frills. We do offer good old-fashioned hard-core

The key to this workout is loading. Err on the heavy side and you are going to get crushed by the 1-arm situps. Err on the light side and you will sail through. Find the happy medium and you will hit 1 hour on the nose.

On the climbing front, the new ice holds went up today and Kevin was the first to give them a try. He is already pretty adept at swinging and sticking. Next is to increase the time he can spend on the holds. Pretty exciting to see how it will transfer to the real ice.')[0m

Ten weeks ago Joey Thompson came to the Alpine Training Center with the sole purpose of getting stronger for his alpine ski guide certification course. His skills as a guide are unquestionable but he questioned his strength for 10 days of a very intensive ski training course. Our mission: get him strong. One of his first training sessions included walking lunges with a 25# pack...it crushed him we both knew the road that lay ahead. But he didn''t stop but set in and worked harder. Tonight he repeated that same series of stepups and walking lunges and he crushed it! Many nights of hard work in the gym has him ready and stronger than ever. Good luck Joey! ')[0m

Interesting to watch the athletes today as many struggled through the ski hops and tucks. We have done these before but today they were particulary devastating. Tired from a week of training? Improper warmup? Or just plain too much? The evening session did a different warmup to see if that was it - nope. Having done them before, the volume shouldn''t have been too much.

The first week of 8 rounds of 30 sec ski hops with 30 sec tuck hold is miles away and way to easy now. We have progressed to 8 rounds of 1 min hops and 1 min tuck and 30 sec rest. No joke. Two minutes of wall sits now seem almost as hard as the 30 sec wall sit we started with. Probably don''t need to mention leg blasters. But I will. We finished Monday with 6 rounds of full leg blasters with just 30 seconds rest. Left most everyone tired for several days. But when they go to ski, they will secretly thank me - pretty sure. The final round of sandbag getups was still hard, they never get easier, but many increased their reps significantly.

What does this all mean? For the skiers, they will be stronger, last longer, be more durable and hopefully avoid injury. For non-skiers, pretty sure they have the strongest legs they have ever had, along with a few bonus sandbag getups.

Coming up next is an unload week. A chance to rest & recover. Give the knees a break from the squatting and jumping and give the mind a rest from all the hard work.')[0m

What does this all mean? For the skiers, they will be stronger, last longer, be more durable and hopefully avoid injury. For non-skiers, pretty sure they have the strongest legs they have ever had, along with a few bonus sandbag getups.

Coming up next is an unload week. A chance to rest & recover. Give the knees a break from the squatting and jumping and give the mind a rest from all the hard work.')[0m

The key to this workout is loading. Err on the heavy side and you are going to get crushed by the 1-arm situps. Err on the light side and you will sail through. Find the happy medium and you will hit 1 hour on the nose.

Ten weeks ago Joey Thompson came to the Alpine Training Center with the sole purpose of getting stronger for his alpine ski guide certification course. His skills as a guide are unquestionable but he questioned his strength for 10 days of a very intensive ski training course. Our mission: get him strong. One of his first training sessions included walking lunges with a 25# pack...it crushed him we both knew the road that lay ahead. But he didn''t stop but set in and worked harder. Tonight he repeated that same series of stepups and walking lunges and he crushed it! Many nights of hard work in the gym has him ready and stronger than ever. Good luck Joey! ')[0m

Interesting to watch the athletes today as many struggled through the ski hops and tucks. We have done these before but today they were particulary devastating. Tired from a week of training? Improper warmup? Or just plain too much? The evening session did a different warmup to see if that was it - nope. Having done them before, the volume shouldn''t have been too much.

The key to this workout is loading. Err on the heavy side and you are going to get crushed by the 1-arm situps. Err on the light side and you will sail through. Find the happy medium and you will hit 1 hour on the nose.

On the climbing front, the new ice holds went up today and Kevin was the first to give them a try. He is already pretty adept at swinging and sticking. Next is to increase the time he can spend on the holds. Pretty exciting to see how it will transfer to the real ice.')[0m

Ten weeks ago Joey Thompson came to the Alpine Training Center with the sole purpose of getting stronger for his alpine ski guide certification course. His skills as a guide are unquestionable but he questioned his strength for 10 days of a very intensive ski training course. Our mission: get him strong. One of his first training sessions included walking lunges with a 25# pack...it crushed him we both knew the road that lay ahead. But he didn''t stop but set in and worked harder. Tonight he repeated that same series of stepups and walking lunges and he crushed it! Many nights of hard work in the gym has him ready and stronger than ever. Good luck Joey! ')[0m

Interesting to watch the athletes today as many struggled through the ski hops and tucks. We have done these before but today they were particulary devastating. Tired from a week of training? Improper warmup? Or just plain too much? The evening session did a different warmup to see if that was it - nope. Having done them before, the volume shouldn''t have been too much. So must just be a hard week of training...')[0m

For the past 8 weeks we have jumped, squated, tucked, sat on a wall and were destroyed by sandbags. Many are happy to move on. On the plus side, everyone has gotten stronger. The first week of 8 rounds of 30 sec ski hops with 30 sec tuck hold is miles away and way to easy now. We have progressed to 8 rounds of 1 min hops and 1 min tuck and 30 sec rest. No joke. Two minutes of wall sits now seem almost as hard as the 30 sec wall sit we started with. Probably don''t need to mention leg blasters. But I will. We finished Monday with 6 rounds of full leg blasters with just 30 seconds rest. Left most everyone tired for several days. But when they go to ski, they will secretly thank me - pretty sure. The final round of sandbag getups was still hard, they never get easier, but many increased their reps significantly.

What does this all mean? For the skiers, they will be stronger, last longer, be more durable and hopefully avoid injury. For non-skiers, pretty sure they have the strongest legs they have ever had, along with a few bonus sandbag getups.

Coming up next is an unload week. A chance to rest & recover. Give the knees a break from the squatting and jumping and give the mind a rest from all the hard work.')[0m

Training #1 6 rounds of 3x SBGUs ea side, 2 tire jumps and sprint, 10x back extensions 8kg. #2 6 rounds 5x shoulder to shoulder sandbag push presses ea side, 10x Romanian deadlifts, 5x ankle to bar. #3 6 rounds 3x sandbag clean & squat ea side, DB crawl 10m, 10x box jumps, DB crawl 10m. Bonus: 400m sandbag run...enjoying a nice warm spell before Christmas so the 9am crew got to go for a run, outside.

For the tire jump/sprint a good sub would be 4x tuck jumps (knees to chest) and sprint 20m. Shoulder to shoulder push press goes up over the head, use a dumbbell or kettlebell in place of sandbag if necessary. Women did 30-40# and Men were anywhere from 45-60#. ')[0m

Training 1. Work up to 1 RM of front squat 2. 6 rounds of 2x front squat at 85%, 5x broad jumps, 10x glute leg raise ea side. 3. 6 rounds of 3x Curtis Ps, 1x sprint lap, frog stretch for count of 3 4. 6 rounds of 5x Bench press, 5x pullups, 10x poorman''s hyper.

The plank kick is a new one for us. From the standard front plank position the leg is "kicked" to the side and then back to center. Do 10 on each leg - no rest between sides. Tougher than it sounds - but then you probably already knew that.')[0m

Lucky for them they were the experimental group and did a little more suffering than everyone else.

It started as Warmup of 4 rounds of 50x stepups, 10x Overhead squats w/ PVC, 60 sec ab bridge complex. Training 15 - 1 Deadlifts, 1-arm situps, corkscrews, toes 2 sky and Overhead lunge steps. It quickly went to a 13-1 countdown and still it was too much for many of the athletes.

The key to this workout is loading. Err on the heavy side and you are going to get crushed by the 1-arm situps. Err on the light side and you will sail through. Find the happy medium and you will hit 1 hour on the nose.

On the climbing front, the new ice holds went up today and Kevin was the first to give them a try. He is already pretty adept at swinging and sticking. Next is to increase the time he can spend on the holds. Pretty exciting to see how it will transfer to the real ice.')[0m

Ten weeks ago Joey Thompson came to the Alpine Training Center with the sole purpose of getting stronger for his alpine ski guide certification course. His skills as a guide are unquestionable but he questioned his strength for 10 days of a very intensive ski training course. Our mission: get him strong. One of his first training sessions included walking lunges with a 25# pack...it crushed him we both knew the road that lay ahead. But he didn''t stop but set in and worked harder. Tonight he repeated that same series of stepups and walking lunges and he crushed it! Many nights of hard work in the gym has him ready and stronger than ever. Good luck Joey! ')[0m

Interesting to watch the athletes today as many struggled through the ski hops and tucks. We have done these before but today they were particulary devastating. Tired from a week of training? Improper warmup? Or just plain too much? The evening session did a different warmup to see if that was it - nope. Having done them before, the volume shouldn''t have been too much. So must just be a hard week of training...')[0m

For the past 8 weeks we have jumped, squated, tucked, sat on a wall and were destroyed by sandbags. Many are happy to move on. On the plus side, everyone has gotten stronger. The first week of 8 rounds of 30 sec ski hops with 30 sec tuck hold is miles away and way to easy now. We have progressed to 8 rounds of 1 min hops and 1 min tuck and 30 sec rest. No joke. Two minutes of wall sits now seem almost as hard as the 30 sec wall sit we started with. Probably don''t need to mention leg blasters. But I will. We finished Monday with 6 rounds of full leg blasters with just 30 seconds rest. Left most everyone tired for several days. But when they go to ski, they will secretly thank me - pretty sure. The final round of sandbag getups was still hard, they never get easier, but many increased their reps significantly.

What does this all mean? For the skiers, they will be stronger, last longer, be more durable and hopefully avoid injury. For non-skiers, pretty sure they have the strongest legs they have ever had, along with a few bonus sandbag getups.

Coming up next is an unload week. A chance to rest & recover. Give the knees a break from the squatting and jumping and give the mind a rest from all the hard work.')[0m
